Supabase Configuration/setup

[] - setup Tips that has the same structure as a course just with 1 video and maybe a description
[] - add RLS policies to Lesson, Video, Course, & userLessonProgress
[] - add supabase server functions from the vercel/nextjs-subscription starter
[] - create supabase functions for handling mux stuff/video/courses
[] - functions for admin uploading courses
[] - functions for admin uploading lessons
[] - copy functions that use prisma from mux template and replace prisma with supabase

Shadui

[x] - add shadui user settings drop down
[x] - have an avater image that on click shows drop down menu
[] - add dropdown for articles to show most recent articles (use remeda or lodash take function)
[x] - add cards for different home page categories
[x] - instead of the table design, have cards for:
[x] - work history
[x] - courses
[x] - social links (linkedin, twitter, and youtube)

Stripe (all of this can be taken from nextjs subscription payment starter)
[] - add webhook
[] - add utils
[] - add fixtures
[] - add api routes for create-checkout-session and create-portal-link
[] - add components
[] - create test links for payments for courses
[] - probably want to go the wes bos route (not sure if subscriptions is something I want to do)
[] - each course would have a highlight section and then clicking it would take the user to a course details page
[] - should it all be housed in the app? I think so but need to evaluate

<!-- For Disabling Javascript -->

[x] - make navbar static or do I just want links in home page sections?
[x] - have links throughout home page to different pages
[] - have links on articles page to go to home page (breadcrumb)

<!-- FALLS UNDER HANDLING THE DISABLING OF JS: For the below Items I just changed the data loading to not be 'force-dynamic' -->

[x] - Move data loading and useEffects for tracking article views into an isolated client componet
[x] - This will still allow for loading the article detail info without showing comments

<!-- Currently wherever I have suspense there is an infinite loading state if js is off -->
<!-- Investigate how to handle this -->

[] - Migrate all articles to use contentlayer - (this will remove need for dynamic loading aside from comments but can probably move this to static)
[] - Everytime I publish an article it will set off a build rather than having to worry about anything in sanity
